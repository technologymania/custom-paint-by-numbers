        <h2>What is Pay-Per-Call (PPC) Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
        <p>The Pay-Per-Call (PPC) model revolutionizes digital marketing by focusing on phone calls rather than clicks. Advertisers only pay for genuine, qualified phone calls made by potential customers through affiliate marketing efforts. This direct communication often results in better conversions compared to traditional Cost-Per-Click (CPC) campaigns.</p>
